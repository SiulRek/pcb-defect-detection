def separate_imports(code_text):
    """
    Reads Python code from a string and separates the lines into import statements and other code.

    This function handles both single-line and multi-line import statements. Multi-line
    imports are assumed to start with 'from ... import (' or 'import (' and end with ')'.
    Lines that are part of a multi-line import statement are grouped together in the import list.
    All other lines, including blank lines outside of import statements, are categorized separately.

    Args:
    code_text (str): A string containing Python code.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing two lists:
        - First list contains lines that are import statements.
        - Second list contains all other lines.
