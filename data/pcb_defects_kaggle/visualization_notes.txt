PCBs used:
	- twolth PCBs are used
	- Lines connected to Pads
	- Lines can be thin or thick, not zig zag, 
	- pads have similar size, shape is mostly cycle
	- Some have shape pads some not
	- Colours mainly green range and gray range
	- Some Pads connected to vias some not.
	- Shapes either rectangle
	- Small variance in via size
	- PCB 11 is easy
	
	01: A lot of Uniform spread small vias, Shape Pads, Almost thin lines, Pads, cylce, square, 
	rectangle, ovalo, no isles, vias almost same area value ...
	04: wider lines than 1.,  parallel lines almost close, less area without copper, some text, feaw isles
		No holes, lines a bit irregular, NO Shape vias
	05. less area without copper, slightly more distance between lines and copper area, small shape vias, 
	mini isles, two big filled cyclic vias, 
	06: Thin lines, Irregular width of lines, Shape pads, equal size vias, many lines compared to others,
	strange free side pads, most cluttered!
	07: Smaller PCB, less lines, complex and irregular line connection in uppder area, shape pads
	08: much White Text, much white drawings, Copper free area in the middle, regular lines connection, component
	pads, Vias are alligned, shape pads.
	9: Shape Pads, Some but less than previously white text and drawings, Component Pad, Good part free copper area,
	Aligned component and vias, 
	10: Smaller PCB, thicker lines, less complex than the others, but the connections of lines are irregular, Has also big
	vias, bias are not of equal size, shape pads
	11: Lines rest are free copper areas, not complex, no shape pads, less lines, no Component Pads, lines of typical lengths,
	12: Small Shape Pads, More lines, Complexity level is higher, Relative regular lines, but the width of the lines vary

Spurious Copper:
	Similar lengths & width, confundable with copper isles, orientation is parallel to neighbours,
	distances of spur to adjacent copper on both horizontal sides are mostly unequal, distance to side
	is sometimes close, Shapes (short thin lines with curvy end) are equal, colour on spur uniform, 
	each spur same color, PCB 12 and 6 lead most likely to failure, PCB 11 is easy, PCB 5 spurs seem longer, 
	PCB 4 they are more close to sides, PCb 1 you can exchange them with lines, somethimes in 1
	not parallel to closest side 8just slightly differing or parallel to other side), slightly noisy line
	
Spur: 
	Similar to spurious Copper only difference is that spur is completly binded at one site, 1/3 or half of the spur overlaps side	copper,
	as lines are wider spur is less noticable in 11, Sometimes two halfly overlapping spurs (one above the other), 
	Sometimes spur form of a noisy triangle, always attached to straight line, e.g.10 the noisy lines and forms can
	already be confunded with spurs, spurs are small in 1 (really small), 6, 9 and 8 in relation to image, 
	most of the time clearly separable from line itself, 6 already appears cluttered probably most difficult, 
	usually separable from line copper as density is slightly higher, it is also separable from curvy shapes as it usually does not so
	fluently with the environment, some contours of curves in 4 can be exchanged as spur, in 1 they are even small in length
	
Short:
	short orhogonal connections of two parallel lines, usually not on edges,not always orthogonal, similar width as lines on side or smaller,
	can be longer sometimes, on 4 it gets stranger as it not always connects to parallel lines and also the "Schnittpunkte" are orthogonal,
	like spur or spurious copper with the difference it connects to lines, sometimes really short when lines are close than they are nearly not rectangular,
	the shape of the short connection is almost always a slighlty noisy line, 6 is hart as connections are shorter, always connects to copper never vias so
	there is a separation to short lines connecting to vias (e.g. 6), in e.g. 4 the density seem slightly lower as lines on side, whats interesting in e.g. 1 there are
	pad connections looking similar to shorts, short connection from vias and copper area are never shorts!
	
Oper Circuit:
	Line is interrupted completly, open circuit area color is similar as line surrounding area color, Sometimes color a bit different than it 
	has the form of a line like spurious copper is longer as open line wide, It cuts the line not always orthogonal, useually on straight part of line
	cannot be easily exchange with other part of PCB except maybe cluttered parts with isles, sometimes not line forms but trapezoids, when lines are touching
	each other nearly and have angles this can be confundet width opencircuits. open circuit line width not much porpotional to line width

Mouse Bite:
	Cuts line in convex form, the form itself is noisy not a perfect half cycle or ellipse, does not fully disconnect line, color slightly different
	from free copper area, the form does not only cover the line but also a part of free copper area, never on copper areas, reaches more than half or half the 
	width usually, e.g. PCb 10 has some snakk convex form invading the copper area that can be exchanged with mouse bite, nearly always on straight part of lines,
	sometimes mouse bite nearly reaches the other site, sometimes like in 8 a bit darker, sometimes not cycle form more form of rectangle/line, 
	on PCB 1 they are small and not easy to find... often just 1 or 2 here.
	
Missing Hole:
	Almost always in the center of a via of cyclic oval or rectangular shape is a cycle filled with the color green, can be in every via, the ratio of covered and not covered via area
	varyies a lot, can be in every via, often around 5 missing holes, like in 08 there are vias with hole that can be exchanged with missing holes, but they have a yello annular instead of gray,
	always filled with green, othervwise no missing hole (e.g. in 06 south-east), 
	
	
	
TODO:
	Check if the objects are always of same colour
