# Data Folder

This folder contains datasets used in the PCB Defect Detection project. The primary dataset currently available is:

## PCB Defects Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Description:** The "pcb_defect_kaggle" dataset is provided by the Open Lab on Human Robot Interaction of Peking University. It features various types of PCB defects created using Adobe Photoshop. The defect categories included in this dataset are: missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short, spur, and spurious copper.

## DeepPCB (tangsali5201)
- **Description:** DeepPCB: a dataset contains 1,500 image pairs, each of which consists of a defect-free template image and an aligned tested image with annotations including positions of 6 most common types of PCB defects: open, short, mousebite, spur, pin hole and spurious copper.
