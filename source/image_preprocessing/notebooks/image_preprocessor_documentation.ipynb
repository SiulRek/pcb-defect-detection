    "## 1. Introduction to the PCB Defect Detection Project\n",
    "Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components of electronic devices, but detecting defects during production is difficult. These flaws can have an impact on device performance and safety, making detection a critical step.[[1]](#references) Through Machine Learning (ML), the hope is to improve this detection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "While traditional methods of inspecting PCBs, such as Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) systems, are used, they frequently struggle with the complexity of modern PCB designs, resulting in false positivesâ€”incorrectly marking good areas as defective.[[1]](#references) This challenge underscores the importance of the ML approach, which requires the availability of high-quality image data suitable for effective machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stages of the PCB Defect Detection Workflow** \n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of a system for detecting defects in PCBs follows a structured workflow that includes several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying Defect Types: Specifying the types of defects to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Preprocessing: Collecting and preparing images in preparation for model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Development: creating an ML model for exact defect detection in PCBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model optimization: is about training the model with high-quality data in order to validate accuracy and reduce false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stages of the preceding list represent the critical phases in the development of the PCB defect detection tool. Given the model's dynamic nature, which may necessitate optimization, retraining with new data, adjustments for detecting different defect types, or producing different outputs, these stages are expected to be cyclical. This iterative approach highlights the significance of continuous improvement response to readapted detection requirements. This is why a solid test strategy is also required to make these cycles easier while ensuring the tool's effectiveness and functionality when changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus of this Documention**\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this documentation is the image preprocessing framework, an important component in preparing images for analysis by the PCB defect detector model.  Image preprocessing involves transforming raw image data into a format that is not only standardized but also optimized for compatibility with ML models. It entails filtering the images, maintaining consistency, and bringing them up to a quality from which the machine learning model may effectively learn.[[2]](#references)"

    "## 2. The Role of Image Preprocessing\n",
    "When working with images in the ML process, image preprocessing is a critical stage. It's not only about getting the images ready; it's also about making sure they're in good enough condition for the models to learn from. Here are the main reasons on why it is critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formatting and Standardization: Images must be correctly formatted before being fed into a ML model. This includes ensuring that their colors are altered as needed, positioned correctly, and that they are all the same size. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require this since their layers expect uniformly sized inputs.[[2]](#references)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quality Improvement: Good preprocessing aids in extracting the relevant features of an image from which the model must learn. Preprocessing seeks to improve image data by improving specific visual attributes that are crucial for subsequent processing and analysis activities or suppressing undesired distortions.[[3]](#references) The goal is to enhance the quality of the data so that the model can deal with it more effectively. Just as numbers are normalized and standardized in other ML Solutions, image preprocessing ensures that the model sees the images in a way that allows it to learn effectively.[[4]](#references)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased Speed: When images are properly preprocessed, everything else in the machine learning process may move more quickly. Training models can take less time, and predictions can be made more quickly. This is especially significant when a large number of images exists to sort through because it allows us to accomplish more in less time.[[2]](#references)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, preprocessing is suggested, not only for PCB defect detection, but also for any other image-based ML project. It improves the model's performance, provides faster results, and guarantees that the learning process runs smoothly."

    "## 3. Preprocessing Experiences\n",
    "At the beginning of my journey to develope a tool for PCB defect detection using ML, I created a dedicated Jupyter Notebook called [image_preprocessing_evaluation.ipynb](./image_preprocessing_evaluation.ipynb). This notebook was used to evaluate multiple image preprocessing procedures, each aiming to enhance the quality of PCB images for improved defect detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Preprocessing Steps Investigated**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Histogram Equalization: Balances image contrast.\n",
    "1. Noise Reduction: Clears up image clarity.\n",
    "1. Grayscale Conversion: Simplifies image complexity.\n",
    "1. Resizing: Standardizes image dimensions.\n",
    "1. Perspective Correction: Aligns image orientation (work in progress).\n",
    "1. Thresholding: Enhances specific image features.\n",
    "1. Morphological Operations: Attempts to refine image texture (results were mixed).\n",
    "1. Normalization: Adjusts pixel value scales.\n",
    "1. Standardization: Aims for uniform pixel values (found redundant after Thresholding or Normalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating these preprocessing steps, the Kaggle PCB Defect Dataset [[5]](#references) was utilized.\n",
    "The TensorFlow framework was used to handle the image collection efficiently.\n",
    "I included in the TensorFlow framework built-in image preprocessing routines from OpenCV (cv2), allowing for easy application of preprocessing stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Realizations and insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on the notebook, I became aware of the vast number of potential image preprocessing steps and parameters. The global histogram equalization stage was a prime example (see code snippet above). The preprocessing step included mapping each image to the `global_histogram_equalization` function. Following this mapping, the images, which were originally in TensorFlow format, were transformed to OpenCV format. In this format, the equalization procedure was then implemented. Finally, the images were transformed back to TensorFlow format for additional processing or analysis. This method used in the notebook highlighted the difficulties and limitations of developing basic function-based solutions:\n",
    "- Sequence Flexibility: Each experiment with different preprocessing steps required altering the dataset mapping sequence. This method included carefully aligning each step to ensure that the output of one preprocessing step was correctly fed into the next. The procedure was prone to errors, as accidental misalignments or incorrect dataset mappings could easily occur, resulting in wrong results and further debugging efforts.\n",
    "- Parameter Adjustability: Changing preprocessing parameters was limited to changes within the functions themselves. This lack of flexibility hindered automatic variations or dynamic adaptations, limiting the ability to efficiently explore and optimize different preprocessing parameter settings.\n",
    "- Reproducibility: Without the ability to serialize (save and load) the specific sequence of preprocessing steps, it becomes difficult to replicate the exact same preprocessing sequence for other datasets or experimental circumstances. This makes consistent evaluation and comparison of results difficult.\n",
    "- Modularity and Integration: The inability to serialize preprocessing sequences restricts the potential for integrating the developed processes sequence into larger, more complex systems. Ideally, a successful preprocessing sequence should be saved to a file, which can then be easily loaded and applied in other modules or projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It became clear that a more integrated and adaptable preprocessing solution was required. In response to this realization, the following chapter discusses the development of a robust framework aimed at addressing these complexities, subsequently progressing the development of the PCB defect detection tool.\n",

    "## 4. Inspiration and Framework Conceptualization\n",
    "The knowledge gained from testing various image preprocessing techniques, together with the insights gained from practicing basic machine learning in Python with scikit-learn, a famous Python machine learning tool, has lead me to a significant realization. Especially the pipeline technique employed in scikit-learn inspired me. A `Pipeline` object in scikit-learn applies a sequence of transformations and a final estimator successively.[[6]](#references) The result of the preceding phase is fed into each stage of the `Pipeline`, speeding the data processing and modeling process. This method is extremely useful for assuring a consistent and efficient process, especially when doing many data transformation phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This inspiration sparked the idea for a comparable approach for image preprocessing in PCB defect detection. Unlike the scikit-learn `Pipeline`, which involves learning from data and includes a fitting process, the image preprocessing framework focuses solely on transforming or processing the data without any learning or fitting stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The envisioned framework seeks to provide an organized and fast approach to apply multiple preprocessing steps to images. This framework not only allows for simple experimentation with different combinations of steps, but also aligns with the need for systematic and reproducible preprocessing in ML for image analysis. This chapter represents the start of the projects target to develop an efficient image preprocessing tool for PCB defect detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections of the documentation lead through the image preprocessing framework step by step, enabling interactive reading (running of Jupyter Notebook Python cells). Throughout these sections, links to software modules can be found, providing further insights and answers on implementation questions that may arise while reading. Additionally, a chapter titled [Author's Q&A](#authors-qa) is included, which aims to address various questions about the rationale behind certain implementation decisions."

    "The `ClassInstancesSerializer` is an important tool for converting complex class instances into JSON format and vice versa, which is essential for saving and loading the configurations of image preprocessing pipelines. The class is built on the premise that class instances must contain a `parameters` attribute, and optionally, an `arguments_datatype` for proper serialization and deserialization. This is because in addition to managing parameters, the `ClassInstancesSerializer` employs recursive type conversion to ensure that data types align correctly with class attributes. The attentive reader probably noticed that the data types of certain parameter values in the JSON file do not match the data types of the related preprocessing step parameter. That discrepancy is precisely why recursive type conversion is required as part of the serialization. To further clarify, this requirement derives from JSON's inherent inability to accurately represent some Python data structures, particularly tuples and nested tuples. More insights on the data type conversion of the image preprocessing framework can be found in [recursive_type_conversion_test.py](../../utils/tests/recursive_type_conversion_test.py). It is also important to highlight that the `instance_mapping` attribute is vital for initializing instances of mapped classes from configurations stored in JSON. \n",

    "## Author's Q&A\n",
    "**Q: How does the ImagePreprocessor differ from and compare to the Scikit-learn Pipeline?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ImagePreprocessor` of the image preprocessing framework is inspired on scikit-learn's `Pipeline`, although its focus and functionality differ. It processes image data through a list of steps, defined in the attribute `pipeline` using a single `process` method, ensuring a consistent, non-adaptive flow. This approach differs from scikit-learn's `Pipeline`, which not only analyzes data but also learns from it using fit and transform methods, allowing for data-driven dynamic adaptability. As previously stated in the [chapter 4](#4-inspiration-and-framework-conceptualization). This difference highlights the `ImagePreprocessor`'s focus on executing a fixed sequence of image-specific preprocessing operations, whereas scikit-learn's `Pipeline` provides a more flexible, general and integrated approach capable of learning from and adapting to the data it processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the `ImagePreprocessor` serves as the key orchestrator in its structure, handling a list of processing steps, collectively referred to as pipeline, that are specialized for image processing. Contrary to this, within the scikit-learn ecosystem, the `Pipeline` assumes the role of orchestrating the data processing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What type of dataset is used in the PCB Defect Detection Project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, called `image_dataset` from this yupiter notebook, is a TensorFlow dataset in the form of `tf.data.Dataset`. It consist of tuples, each containing an image as tensor of type `tf.uint8` and its associated defect category code of type `tf.int8`. This dataset is then prefetched to improve data loading efficiency during preprocessing and model training. The technique for constructing the `image_dataset` can be found in [get_tf_dataset.py](../../load_raw_data/get_tf_dataset.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What influenced the decision to use TensorFlow's dataset format to represent image datasets in the preprocessing framework?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The primary motivation for using TensorFlow datasets (TDFS) in the form of `tf.data.Dataset` objects for image dataset representation is their inherent preformance characteristics and performance optimization features. These characteristics are very useful when dealing with great amounts of data. One cornerstone of TensorFlow's performance optimization, also used in the image preprocessing framework, is the parallelization of operations. This can be done by TensorFlow's data API's `map` function, intended to process data elements concurrently. This parallel processing considerably reduces the time required for data preparation and transformation.[[7]](#references). To demonstrate the efficiency, consider the execution time of the Python cells within this very Jupyter Notebook, which processed 693 images from the dataset using pipelines consisting of 5 to 6 preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while TensorFlow's dataset format provides significant performance benefits, it also presents debugging challenges due to its complex graph execution model. As a result, when implementing a preprocessing framework with TensorFlow, careful software development and thorough testing are required to ensure the the framework is working and to prevent difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why are images and targets kept together in the preprocessing pipeline?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Images and their matching targets are processed as pairs in the preprocessing pipeline to guarantee that each image remains correctly matched with its target. This strategy eliminates the possibility of an image being incorrectly linked with another target. Although this is a point of ongoing discussion, the strategy is being maintained for data integrity. In the development of the PCB defect detector model, the possibility of improving this aspect will be reconsidered to determine if separate image and target processing is more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What color channels are accepted in the image preprocessing framework?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The image preprocessing framework primarly focuses on grayscale and RGB color channels. This because: \n",
    "- Widespread use of RGB and grayscale: RGB and grayscale are the most widely used color channels in image processing, making them practical defaults for many applications.[[7][8]](#references).\n",
    "- Ease of visual inspection: Matplotlib, a popular Python package, provides handy methods for showing pictures in grayscale and RGB, making the visualization process easier during preprocessing.\n",
    "- Prevent unnecessary complication: Adding more color representations would complicate the framework inappropriately, which could impact performance and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the framework's preprocessing steps are intended to accept both grayscale and RGB inputs. They must output data in the same color space as the input, unless a specific step requires color channel conversion. This consistency in input and output color spaces guarantees that the preprocessing pipeline is uniform. However, if a preprocessing step necessitates a temporary conversion to a different color space for processing, it must convert the data back to its original color space before outputting. It is worth to mention, that this 'maintain the same color space' requirement is verified from a framework's test suite described in [single_step_test.py](../tests/single_step_test.py). The test suite ensures that a step complies with the aforementioned criteria before it is integrated into the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How are the input and output data types managed in the image preprocessing framework?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In the image preprocessing framework, the handling of data types for images and targets is carefully managed by each preprocessing step to ensure compatibility and efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default Data Types:  The pipeline primarily uses tf.uint8 for images and tf.int8 for targets, as outlined in the [step_base.py](../preprocessing_steps/step_base.py) file. \n",
    "- Acceptance of Input Data Types: All preprocessing steps must accept images in the tf.uint8 default data type. This requirement is essential for mantaining constistency when executing multiple steps within a pipeline and is tested by the test suite in [single_step_test.py](../tests/single_step_test.py).\n",
    "- Variability in Accepted Data Types: The specific image data types that can be accepted as inputs may vary depending on the implementation of each preprocessing step. In the case that a step integrates an OpenCV function, for instance, the accepted input data types would depend from those that OpenCV supports.\n",
    "- Output Data Type of Images: The output data type for images from each preprocessing step can either adhere to the default (tf.uint8) or be a specific data type defined by the step itself. This is also tested in the previously stated test suite. This flexibility allows for steps that might require different data types due to the nature of their processing. However, any change from the default data type must be specified in detail in the step's docstring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the pipeline's design balances the need for standardization (via default data types) with the flexibility to accommodate specific preprocessing step requirements. This method guarantees that the pipeline is robust, modular, and capable of effectively handling a wide range of preprocessing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is the purpose of the _raise_step_process_exception attribute in the ImagePreprocessor class?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The `_raise_step_process_exception attribute` is a flag used to determine error handling behavior during the image preprocessing pipeline's execution. This variable, when set to False, guarantees that any exceptions that arise during a preprocessing step are properly loggedÂ rather than raised.Â In this case, the pipeline will halt the current processing, log the exception, return None, and proceed to the next preprocessing sequence, if available. This is especially helpful when processing several pipelines in as it's preferable to have uninterrupted execution even in the event that individual cases contain errors. On the other hand, standard exception handling occurs when this flag is set to True. Errors are raised instantaneously, stopping execution to enable prompt investigation and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why does StepBase only use the TensorFlow map method with the tf.py_function wrapper for its preprocessing steps?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The map method in TensorFlow is optimized for operations that are inherently TensorFlow functions. Nevertheless, almost all preprocessing step use Python-specific constructs, such as conditional statements to determine the number of color channels in an image tensor. These Pythonic expressions aren't natively supported in TensorFlow's computation graph without explicit wrapping. The `tf.py_function` wrapper offers this required wrapping, allowing these Pythonic components to be integrated into the TensorFlow workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, an intricate bug was discovered where certain pipeline configurations led to unexpected behavior. For instance, applying a preprocessing step implemented with TensorFlow functions without the `tf.py_function` wrapper followed by a color channel conversion step resulted in the conversion not being executed for some specific pipeline configurations. This issue did not trigger any errors and was only uncovered through detailed debugging. It was discovered that using the `map` function directly with Pythonic functions, including basic constructs such as a single `if` statement, could result to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there is room for optimization in this particular context as already mentioned in chapter [Conclusion and Futher steps](#12-conclusion-and-further-steps). Efficiency can be increased by refactoring steps that process tensors to use native TensorFlow functions (e.g., substituting TensorFlow's conditional operations for Python `if` statements). This would enable potential for a new decoratorâ€”possibly called `tensor_tffunc_wrapper`â€”that would improve processing efficiency by allowing direct mapping to TensorFlow functions without requiring `tf.py_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:  Why do all arguments in the preprocessing step classes have default values?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: There are three reasons for this:\n",
    "- Specify Format: They provide the format of each argument.\n",
    "- Starting Point for Experimantation: They provide a basic default value that can be used as a starting point for experimantation or as a reference for identifying appropriate values.\n",
    "- Improved Readability of Test Suite: Because default values can be used during instantiation, they improve the readability of the test suite for testing preprocessing procedures. Note: Omitting default values might lead to errors in some test cases that verify the functionality of the preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why was the JSON format chosen for serialization in the ClassInstancesSerializer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Three significant considerations impacted the choice to use JSON in the `ClassInstancesSerializer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Editable: The static modifiability of JSON is a critical characteristic. It enables fast and direct changes to parameters, ranges, or distributions, which is not possible with formats such as pickle, which generates binary files.\n",
    "- Readability and Clarity: JSON stands out for its ease of use and widespread acceptance, allowing for transparent serialized data management. In comparison, XML, while still human readable, is more verbose and less user-friendly.\n",
    "- Hierarchical Data Representation: Because the configuration of the preprocessing pipeline is inherently complicated, it benefits from a format that can effectively describe hierarchical structures. JSON outperforms CSV in this aspect, whereas CSV is better suited for simpler, tabular data and can become tedious with complex nested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, JSON was chosen because of its simplicity of modification, readability, and flexibility to express complicated hierarchical data structures. These characteristics make it a solid option for serialized data management within the image preprocessing framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: In the JSON configuration of the preprocessing pipeline, is there a method to include the same preprocessing step multiple times without causing conflicts?**\n",
    "\n",
    " While it is relatively rare to encounter such a scenario, it is indeed possible to include the same preprocessing step multiple times within a JSON-configured preprocessing pipeline. In this case, to avoid potential conflicts with the JSON format, a unique key naming mechanism is employed. This is where the method `_generate_unique_key_name method` of the `ClassInstancesSerializer` becomes crucial. The class and the method are defined in [class_instances_serializer.py](../../utils/class_instances_serializer.py).\n",
    "\n",
