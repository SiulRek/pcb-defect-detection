# PCB Defect Detection Project

## Overview
This project is part of my System Test Engineering coursework, supervised by Mr. Schappacher. The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Define and understand different types of PCB defects.
- Develop a comprehensive data preparation strategy for PCB defect detection.
- Construct a suitable machine-learning model in Python for defect identification.
- Implement model training and evaluation mechanisms to ensure model accuracy.
- Validate the model's applicability and reliability on a new dataset.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
