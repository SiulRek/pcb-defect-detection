# PCB Defect Detection Project

## Overview
This project is part of my System Test Engineering coursework, supervised by Ms. Schappacher. The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Define and understand different types of PCB defects.
- Develop a comprehensive data preparation strategy for PCB defect detection.
- Construct a suitable machine-learning model in Python for defect identification.
- Implement model training and evaluation mechanisms to ensure model accuracy.
- Validate the model's applicability and reliability on a new dataset.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Code:** Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model development, and image preprocessing.

- **Data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing and processed data.

- **Documentation:** Contains project documentation, reports, and any research materials.

- **Environment:** Contains information to set up the project environment.

- **Images:** Contains image-related outputs.

- **References:** Contains external references.

- **Results:** Stores model evaluation results.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/SiulRek/pcb-defect-detection.git
