# Next Meeting Agenda

## Date:
After November 05, 2023

## Topics of Discussion

### 1. Questions
- Is the tensorflow datatype for the dataset and the general implementation of the processing steps suitable for pcb defect detection? (Related to [file](./source/image_preprocessing/notebooks/image_preprocessing_evaluation.ipynb))
- Is the general approach and implementation of the `ImagePreprocessor` acceptable? (Related to  [file](./source/image_preprocessing/tests/image_preprocessing_test.py))
- What are common solutions to find the best fitting preprocessing steps and parameters for Machine Learning Problems related to images?

### 2. Project Changes
- Data loading and initial preparation.
- First evaluation of the image preprocessing steps suitable for the pcb defect detection.
- Creation of `ImagePreprocessor` class.

### 3. Current Plans
- Implementation of image preprocessing steps to be added to the `ImagePreprocessor.pipeline`.
- Determination of suitable parameter ranges for the steps.
- Second evaluation of the image preprocessing steps suitable for the pcb defect detection.
- (General planning of `PCBDefectDetector`Model).
